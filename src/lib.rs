/*! **Safe** `mmap()` with **snapshot isolation** and **atomic commits**.

([Linux-only](#os-support), [works best](#performance) on XFS/btrfs.)

## Example

```rust
# use mmap_snapshot::Mmap;
# fn foo() -> std::io::Result<()> {
# let path = std::path::Path::new("/tmp/foo");
# std::fs::write(&path, b"Hello world!")?;
let mut mmap = Mmap::open(&path)?;
assert_eq!(mmap.as_ref(), b"Hello world!");
mmap.as_mut()[6..11].copy_from_slice(b"sekai");
mmap.commit()?;
assert_eq!(std::fs::read_to_string(&path)?, "Hello sekai!");
# Ok(())
# }
```

## Safety

The unsafe thing about mmapping a file is that what you get is volatile memory -
when someone modifies the file, the memory changes.  This is not the way a
respectable `&[u8]` should behave.

Instead of mapping the file directly, our trick is to map a private "snapshot"
of the file which doesn't change, even when the file is modified.
The *only* way to modify the snapshot is via the mmap,
which makes it a valid `&mut [u8]` according to Rust's rules.

<div class="warning">

There are a few crates out there which expose "safe" `mmap()` without doing
anything to ensure that the file isn't externally modified.  These are simply
unsound and should not be used!  If you want to risk UB, that's fine - use
[`memmap2`](https://crates.io/crates/memmap2) and write the `unsafe` yourself.

</div>

## OS support

We make the snapshot by cloning the original file into an unlinked file.
It's impossible for anyone else to modify this file, which is what makes it safe to mmap.
On Linux we use `O_TMPFILE` for this.
I don't know of a race-free way to create an unlinked file on MacOS/Windows;
if one exists, please open an issue to let me know!

## Performance

This crate has the same semantics on all filesystems, but wildly different
performance characteristics.  This table shows whether methods are constant-time
(✅) or linear-time (⏳️) in the size of the file:

Method | XFS | btrfs | ext4
-------|-----|-------|---------
[`open()`][`Mmap::open`]                         | ✅ | ✅ | ⏳️
[`commit()`][`Mmap::commit`]                     | ✅ | ✅ | ⏳️
[`commit_and_close()`][`Mmap::commit_and_close`] | ✅ | ✅ | ✅

See the method docs for more details.

Although many distros now default to reflink-capable filesystems for new
installs[^debian], it will obviously be common to encounter ext4 in the wild for
many years to come.  Be aware that a subset of your users may experience stalls
when mmapping large files.

[^debian]: The major exceptions are Debian and Ubuntu, which select ext4 by
    default in the installer.  This is, frankly, a bad decision on their part.
    From its creation, ext4 was intended as a "stop-gap" to give people more
    time to migrate away from the ext* family of filesystems.  It shouldn't be
    used for fresh installs.

/// to other processes reading the file until you call `commit()`.  Once you
/// call `commit()`, all your modifications will be atomically visible to other
/// readers.  If you drop the `Mmap` without calling `commit()`, your writes
